# 📘 Students Score Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to predict student scores based on various factors such as hours studied, gender, parental education level, and test preparation course completion. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to provide insights into student performance.

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset comprises the following features:

- **Hours Studied**: Number of hours a student has studied.
- **Gender**: Gender of the student.
- **Parental Level of Education**: Highest education level attained by the student's parents.
- **Test Preparation Course**: Whether the student completed a test preparation course.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Model**: Linear Regression
